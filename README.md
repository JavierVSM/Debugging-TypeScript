Debugging TypeScript and ES6

Copy the code snippets into the TypeScript Playground tool. Identify the errors found in each code snippet. You will see red bars in the Typescript side of the Playground where there is an error.

Fix the errors in the Playground so that all the red bars are gone and the code still runs as desired.

Make comments in the code to explain what each error was and how you fixed it.
For assignment submission, upload a ".ts" file with the contents of the TypeScript Playground.
